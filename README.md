# Urban Floods

This repository gives multiple options to create and enhance flood delineations in urban areas. The methods are not developed by myself, but are provided by scientist from JRC and LIST. These step-by-step procedures are ment to facilitate access to the non-scientific community to these procedures. 

I developed the step-by-step guide during my work at UN-SPIDER in Bonn. The guide was originally planed to serve as a new "Recommended Practice" for flood mapping to the UN-SPIDER knowledge portal: https://www.un-spider.org/advisory-support/recommended-practices

Recommended Practices are designed to bridge the gap between the scientific and disaster management community, to facilitate access to these - in case of disaster - very usefull methods, as they are documented step by step, and require little to no knowledge of remote sensing and geo analysis. They furthermore rely only on open-access data and software.

I developed three guides, which differe in complexity. As each flood is a bit different (different because of the meteorologic circumstances, the damage done or the land cover/use class affected) the three methods differ in their sensitivity with respect to the different flood circumstances.

In the following the three methods are shortly presented. For in depth documentation, you will find slides for each practice in the respective folder in this repository.

## 1. Enhancing GFM derived Flood maps with Digital Terrain Models

## 2. Enhancing GFM derived Flood maps with DTMs and Sentinel-2 water masks

## 3. Flood Mapping and Damage Assessment in Urban Areas with Sentinel-1 Interferometric Coherence
